# CanvasTTY Pixel Theme Contract

A pixel theme has ten PNGs: three terminal sizes (`minimal`, `detailed`,
`master`) times three visual states (`idle`, `working`, `completed`), plus one
workspace `background`. PNGs are inert local images, not CSS or scripts.

## Import in CanvasTTY

Open Settings > Appearance > Terminal borders > Create pixel theme. Give the
theme a name, drop one PNG on each labeled slot, and press Create theme. The
Add PNGs button also accepts all ten files at once when their names end in:

```
minimal_idle.png       minimal_working.png       minimal_completed.png
detailed_idle.png      detailed_working.png      detailed_completed.png
master_idle.png        master_working.png        master_completed.png
background.png
```

A theme prefix is allowed, for example `my_theme_master_done.png`. Legacy
`l1`/`l2` map to minimal/detailed, and `done`/`complete` map to completed.
Files with other names can still be assigned manually. ZIP extraction is not
needed; select the ten PNGs together after generating them.

All nine terminal PNGs must have identical dimensions. The authoring target is
1536x1024 (3:2), matching the fixed 1200x800 logical terminal card. Every PNG must be
320-4096 pixels wide and 200-4096 pixels high, and at most 20 MiB; the whole pack is at most
150 MiB. A static background may have different dimensions. The importer
validates the package and copies it atomically into
`userData/pixel-skins/<id>/`. A rejected package is not installed.

The three aperture tabs in the importer set a separate usable terminal opening
for minimal, detailed, and master, as percentages of frame width/height. Keep
the opening free of important art;
the engine draws the frame beneath a transparent xterm surface, so the artwork
remains visible around the real terminal content. The title, search,
close/restart controls, and PTY stay real
UI, never pixels baked into the image. Leave button artwork and labels out of
the PNG. Reserve a blank control plaque near the top right of every frame,
starting around 73% of image width and 7% of image height, at least 18% wide
and 6% high. The live search, restart, and close buttons are placed there. The
terminal card has a fixed 1200x800 logical size; canvas zoom scales the whole
card without changing the selected art or layout.

## Runtime behavior

- Settings choose minimal or detailed at every zoom level. F4 toggles master
  only for the active terminal; a second F4 returns it to the selected level.
- `working` comes from the provider lifecycle, not terminal text. A provider
  `Stop`, `StopFailure`, or `StopCancelled` hook, or a process `done`/`failed`
  status, selects `completed`. A plain return to `idle` does not. The next
  working turn clears the completed art.
- The frame canvas is noninteractive and below the transparent xterm surface.
  The terminal, title, and controls remain interactive.
- The workspace background uses `cover`. Terminal PNGs are static; no tiny
  procedural Sakura animation is added.

Five built-in themes ship: Sakura, Matrix, Forest Cabin, Gold & Black, and Cat.
Each has three detail levels and completed art. Gold & Black minimal working
currently uses its idle PNG with an activity marker on the top rail; imported
themes require a distinct PNG for every slot.

The built-in art is shipped as AVIF (4:4:4, 1536x1024) to keep the app small;
`node scripts/encode-skin-art.mjs <file.png>...` encodes a new frame or background
with the same settings. Imported themes stay PNG.

## App API

The isolated renderer bridge exposes `window.canvasTTY.pixelSkins.list()`,
`install(request)`, `readAsset(id, slot)`, and `onChanged(listener)`. `install`
accepts `{ name, apertures, files }`, where `files` maps the ten slot names
above to `Uint8Array` PNG bytes. It returns a summary with all three aperture
profiles; set
`settings.terminalBorderSkin` to that ID to activate it. The same validation
and storage are used by the UI. This is an in-app API, not a network endpoint.

## Checks

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Visual acceptance
still requires an isolated Electron dev profile: inspect each level and state,
type and select text in the live terminal, use search/close, change
zoom, press F4 twice, and verify no artwork or controls cover the output.
