/**
 * WebGL renderer slots for terminal cards.
 *
 * A card drawn by xterm's DOM renderer costs the renderer process style, layout and paint for every row
 * it changes; the WebGL renderer draws the same grid from a glyph atlas on the GPU. Every WebGL card
 * holds its own WebGL2 context, and Chromium keeps at most 16 of them alive per renderer process: past
 * that it silently loses the oldest one. So contexts are a bounded pool. Cards on screen ask for one; the
 * pool hands them out by priority (the focused card, then by on-screen area, then by most recent use) and
 * every card without one keeps the DOM renderer, exactly as before.
 *
 * Changes that come from moving the camera settle before the pool acts, and so does every other re-plan
 * (output on a waiting card, a pin running out, a backoff ending): none moves a context until the settle
 * time has passed since the last camera or layout change. A card that holds a context keeps it unless
 * another card is clearly larger on screen, so a pan or a wheel zoom does not create and drop contexts on
 * every frame. A holder that has been idle for a while loses that edge: a card of the same size that is
 * printing output takes its place. A card losing eligibility (semantic zoom, zoom above the raster limit)
 * gives its context back straight away; a card that left the screen gives it back at the next plan.
 *
 * The pool knows nothing about xterm or the DOM: a card registers a client that measures its on-screen
 * rectangle and attaches or detaches the renderer. That keeps the policy testable in node.
 */

/**
 * Contexts the pool hands out. Chromium's limit is 16 active WebGL contexts per renderer process
 * (WebGLRenderingContextBase's active-context cap; the next one evicts the oldest with a console warning).
 * Ten leaves six for everything else in this renderer: plugin canvas apps drawing with WebGL, and released
 * card contexts that are lost but not yet collected. At device pixel ratio 2 a context with its glyph atlas
 * costs roughly 20 MB of GPU memory, so ten cards stay near 200 MB.
